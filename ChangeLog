. Description:

	Internal changes to the C filter program, mainly for future
	extensions I plan to add someday.

	Mail messages in the queue are now *locked* before being processed,
	thereby avoiding duplicate processing in some weird race conditions.
	The 'mailagent -q' command now reports locked messages with a '*'.

	Fixed typo in -r usage summary.

	New -t and -f options for BEGIN and NOP:
		BEGIN -f only occurs if the last command status is false.
		BEGIN -t only occurs if the last command status is true.
		NOP -f forces a false command status (i.e. a failure).
		NOP -t forces a true command status (i.e. a success).
	As a consequence NOP now returns a status or propagates the existing
	one.

	All command options should now be output in bold in the man page.

	Documented _CALLOUT_ working state for callout queue triggers.

	Annotation was not performed for value "0". The use of an
		if $value;
	instead of
		if defined $value;
	was the cause.
	
	The $lastcmd variabe is now global from analyze_mail() for BACK
	processing. It was otherwise impossible to have success/failure
	conditions propagate outside of the BACK execution environment.

	Improved Received: line parsing logic.

	Indication of relaying hosts (RELAYED log) now selectively emitted
	only when the first relaying host is apparently not related to that
	of the sended.

	Fixed ASSGINED -> ASSIGNED typo in log message

	Insert user e-mail address if no address is given for NOTIFY.

	Some small fixes in the regression test suite.

	PATBOUNCE can now handle bounced output from @SH package commands.

	File misc/pbounce/rules now shows how I use PATBOUNCE in my
	own ~/.rules.

. Files changed:

	* agent/filter/io.c: Factorized code to derive a unique filename.

	* agent/filter/lock.c: Added more generic file_lock() and
	file_unlock() routines.

	* agent/filter/lock.h: New generic file_lock() and file_unlock()
	routines.

	* agent/filter/misc.c: Cosmetic change.

	* agent/filter/parser.c: Changed ordering of include files.

	* agent/magent.sh: Call new pmail() routine to process main message. 
	Fixed typo in -r usage.

	* agent/man/mailagent.SH: New -t and -f options for BEGIN and NOP. 
	All command options should now be output in bold.  Documented
	_CALLOUT_ working state for callout queue.

	* agent/pl/acs_rqst.pl: Code factorized within acs_lock().

	* agent/pl/actions.pl: Don't blindly chop command error message,
	remove trailing \n.  Annotation was not performed for value "0".

	* agent/pl/analyze.pl: $lastcmd now global from analyze_mail() for
	BACK processing.  Indication of relaying hosts now selectively
	emitted.

	* agent/pl/filter.pl: Fixed ASSGINED -> ASSIGNED typo in log message.
	Implemented new -t and -f flags for BEGIN and NOP.  Insert user
	e-mail address if no address for NOTIFY.

	* agent/pl/listqueue.pl: Now clearly spot locked files in queue with
	a '*'.

	* agent/pl/parse.pl: Improved Received: line parsing logic.

	* agent/pl/pqueue.pl: Messages in the queue are now locked before
	processing.  New pmail() routine to factorize locking/processing code.

	* agent/pl/runcmd.pl: NOP now returns a status.  Added -t and -f
	switches for BEGIN and NOP.  $lastcmd now global from analyze_mail().

	* agent/test/cmd/split.t: Fixed overzealous unlinks.

	* agent/test/option/c.t: Uses an empty file instead of /dev/null.

	* agent/test/pl/mail.pl: Forgot to unlink mail.lock in cp_mail().

	* misc/pbounce/patbounce.pl: Also handle bounced output from @SH
	package.

. Description:

	Regenerated Configure for getopt() and dup2() checking.

	Updated copyright notice to include year 1997.

	New groupsafe, execskip and lockwarn variables. See the manual
	page entries for a description. Roughly speaking, they
	resepectively control group-writable secure checks, exec-safe
	secure checks and locking warnings when too much time is spent
	waiting for a lock.

	New -o switch for the C filter to redirect output directly from
	the .forward in case shell redirection is not available there...
	See the man page for details.

	The C filter now prefer open(O_APPEND) to fopen("a") for stdio
	append bugs (reported on SUN platforms).

	Made it explicit in the man page that /pattern/i is legal to
	perform a case-insensitive match, as in Perl.

	Made mailagent 'perl -cw' clean and fixed a couple of typos.

	Improved Received: header parsing to avoid warnings.

	The 'unmime -e' un-escape was overzealous for uuencoded parts...
	Made unmime die if an error occurs to prevent feedback from
	occurring in mailagent.

. Files changed:

	* agent/files/mailagent.cf: New groupsafe, execskip and lockwarn
	variables.

	* agent/filter/Jmakefile: Added getopt.c and dup2.c files.

	* agent/filter/getopt.c, agent/filter/dup2.c: Created.

	* agent/filter/io.c: New io_redirect() routine to handle the -o
	switch.

	* agent/filter/io.h: Declared io_redirect().

	* agent/filter/logfile.c: Prefer open(O_APPEND) to fopen("a") for
	stdio append bugs.

	* agent/filter/main.c: Now uses getopt() to parse command line
	switches.  New -o switch to redirect output.

	* agent/filter/parser.c: Skip group-writable and exec-safe checks if
	told to.

	* agent/magent.sh: Used $* variable for no purpose.

	* agent/man/mailagent.SH: Documents new execsafe, groupsafe and
	lockwarn variables.  The C filter can now redirect output via -o. 
	Made it explicit that /pattern/i is legal.

	* agent/pl/acs_rqst.pl: Now supports the lockwarn variable.

	* agent/pl/actions.pl: Made 'perl -cw' clean and fixed a couple of
	typos.

	* agent/pl/callout.pl: Ensure %Header and $wmode are localized in the
	main package.

	* agent/pl/cmdserv.pl: Made 'perl -cw' clean.

	* agent/pl/context.pl: Removed the 'do' workaround for perl5.001.

	* agent/pl/hook.pl: Used $wmode and $loglvl from the wrong package.

	* agent/pl/install.pl: Missed a '$' in front of a variable in
	create().

	* agent/pl/interface.pl: Made use of local $lastcmd instead of main's.

	* agent/pl/parse.pl: Improved Received: header parsing.

	* agent/pl/secure.pl: Now honours groupsafe and execsafe
	configuration variables.

	* agent/pl/stats.pl: Typo fixes and print() call cleanup to avoid
	run-time warnings.

	* agent/test/basic/config.t: Avoid exec-safe checks and
	group-writable directories.

	* misc/mime/unmime: The -e un-escape was overzealous for uuencoded
	parts...  Made the filter die if an error occurs to prevent feedback.

. Description:

	Filter also trap fatal SIGSEGV and SIGBUS signals in C filter.

	Forgot one more get_confval vs get_confstr translation in filter.
	This caused dreadful core dumps, a sure sign being the regression
	test suite mysteriously failing...

	Esacape metacharacter '{' in regexps for perl5.003_20. This
	subversion has been really nitty picky on un-escaped '{'
	without a '}' counterpart. Further subversions have backed-out
	this strict checking however, but the deed is done and I have
	escaped all the culprits!

. Files changed:

	* agent/filter/main.c: Also trap fatal SIGSEGV and SIGBUS signals.

	* agent/filter/parser.c: Forgot one more get_confval vs get_confstr
	translation.

	* agent/pl/stats.pl, agent/pl/lexical.pl, agent/pl/rules.pl,
	agent/pl/analyze.pl: Esacape metacharacter '{' in regexps for
	perl5.003_20.

Wed Jan  8 09:43:56 MET 1997   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Must use get_confstr() to get at the execsafe variable.
	Otherwise, the string value is converted into an integer (0)
	and the following strcasecmp() core dumps.

	It did not happen on my HP-UX machine because dereferencing
	NULL is not a segfault unless some special compiler flag
	is given!!

. Files changed:

	* agent/filter/parser.c: Must use get_confstr() to get at the
	execsafe variable.

Tue Jan  7 19:42:56 MET 1997   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	New execsafe configuration variable to disable extended exec()
	checks when OFF.

	Regenerated agent/filter/Makefile.SH with newer jmake.

	The "no change" optimization was overzealous in package, when
	dealing with 'badaddress' requests (via the new patbounce action).

	Allow for @SH help to be understood, whatever the case.

	Slight mis-parsing of user names with '-' in them could cause
	'package' to not send correct closest addresses.

	Now pre-extend memory in mailagent for large messages to avoid
	many realloc() from stealing all the core! Patch contributed
	by Thomas Richter <richter@chemie.fu-berlin.de>. Thanks!

	Enhanced Received: lines parsing to be less strict on the
	first line (inserted locally).

	Strip out trailing > on addresses, since matching is greedy.
	Patbounce would fail when dealing with <addr@somewhere> since
	the pattern used was matching the trailing '>'.

. Files changed:

	* agent/files/mailagent.cf: New execsafe configuration variable.

	* agent/filter/main.c: Don't use my_exit() when printing version
	number.

	* agent/filter/parser.c: Don't perform extended exec() checks when
	execsafe is OFF.

	* agent/filter/parser.h: New get_confstr() and get_confstr_opt().

	* agent/man/mailagent.SH: Documented new execsafe configuration
	variable.

	* agent/package.SH: The "no change" optimization was overzealous.

	* agent/pl/actions.pl: Allow for @SH help to be understood, whatever
	the case.

	* agent/pl/addr.pl: Slight mis-parsing of user names with '-' in them.

	* agent/pl/emergency.pl: Now pre-extend memory by using existing
	message size.

	* agent/pl/parse.pl: Now pre-extend memory by using existing message
	size.  Enhanced Received: lines parsing.

	* agent/pl/read_conf.pl: New execsafe variable defaults to OFF when
	missing.

	* agent/pl/secure.pl: Now only perform extended exec() checks iff
	execsafe is ON.

	* agent/test/basic/config.t: Force execsafe to OFF when running tests.

	* misc/pbounce/patbounce.pl: Strip out trailing > on addresses, since
	matching is greedy.

Thu Dec 26 11:52:50 MET 1996   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Filter now includes <unistd.h> for R_OK and defines fallbacks
	in case those constants are missing.

	Declared strsave() in case it's not done in <string.h>.

	Fixed an incredible typo while declaring progpath[]. What's
	almost incredible is that my compiler never spotted this one,
	and that the program ran fine with a critical mis-declaration.

	Added undocumented 'badaddress' request for PATBOUNCE support
	in the package command.

	New misc/pbounce directory, containing the PATBOUNCE plug-in.
	This command can be used to automatically remove from the
	users distribution list all the addresses that bounce. You
	cannot imagine how many bounces I've got whith my last patch
	issue. Sure they were deleted, but it's pointless to send
	big messages to people that cannot receive them.

	Five new files (PATBOUNCE command).

. Files changed:

	* agent/filter/io.c: Include <unistd.h> for R_OK and define
	fallbacks.  Declared strsave() in case it's not done in <string.h>. 
	Fixed an incredible typo while declaring progpath[].

	* agent/filter/parser.c: Include <unistd.h> for X_OK and define
	fallbacks.

	* agent/package.SH: Added undocumented 'badaddress' request for
	PATBOUNCE.

	* misc/pbounce/patbounce.pl: Created.

Tue Dec 24 16:34:55 MET 1996   Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	This patch is my Christmas gift to you all, agent-users. I took
	some time to collect, apply, checkin and put together all the
	changes I have been making for more than a year (since last patch).

	I hope this will not introduce any problems and it will probably
	be the last set of patches (modulo possible emergency bug fixes
	following this patch set) before the mailagent-4.0 rewrite, which
	will be runnable only by perl5. I don't think I broke perl4
	compatibility at this point, though I don't know for sure, as I've
	been using perl version 5 for a long time now.

	Okay. Here is the list of changes:

	Important grammatical fix in the Artistic License
	(thanks Tom Christiansen).

	Configure regenerated with newer metaconfig and updated
	my e-mail address

	Filter now read incoming messages in a pool, instead of one big
	chunk. This avoids many realloc() that could get exponentially
	big with large messages.

	Attempt to locate mailagent and perl from the C filter, and
	croak if we cannot find them anywhere in the configured PATH.

	Mailagent and filter now perform basic security checks on
	exec()ed programs. This includes server commands and all the
	programs launched via RUN and friends.

	Filter will log onto stderr if logfile not opened correctly.

	Use more portable real uid/gid setting, i.e. select one
	of the setuid() and setruid() routine, as appropriate.

	The _ character was not correctly parsed in variables, which
	could lead to problem when using $ substitution on them.

	Rule file path is now absolute, so rule caching can be safe,
	even when the same basename is used from two distinct directories.
	This was specially tricky when the '-r rulefile' option was used!

	Changed queue processing/sleeping logic for better interactivity,
	as discussed on the agent-users list, and following an interesting
	e-mail exchange between Randal L. Schwartz and myself.

	Maildist commands and friends now silently discard hostile
	return addresses.

	Added command forwarding support, which allows a package maintainer
	to auto-forward mailagent Command messages to some third party,
	when maintainance of a package is transferred.

	New Relayed: and Envelope: pseudo header computations. The Relayed:
	header is a list of all the mail gateways, as gathered from the
	Received: lines, whilst Envelope refers to the message envelope
	address (first From line).

	Documented the %-H biffing macro with more details.

	Don't use expanded manpath in .so directives. I used to do so,
	but it lead to problems on some platforms. Since that was more
	than a year ago, maybe all the vendors fixed this, hence we
	revert to the initial settings...

	All power-sensitive actions from the server can now be logged
	separately to a file (powerlog in ~/.mailagent).

	Launch sendmail only when the server session is done to avoid
	timeouts on the down side of the pipe!

	Don't dataload the emergency routine to avoid malloc problems
	(since we're probably in a signal handler) and log signal trapping
	even when invoked manually.

	Now correctly initializes @cc to be the Cc: field in for mail hooks.
	Also added @relayed, $lines and $length variables.

	Protect all un-escaped @ in patterns, for perl5.

	Processing of MH profile is now case-insensitive, by popular
	request.

	Allow '-' in package names, distributed through mailagent.

	Default for locksafe is now OFF.

	Fixed some regression tests for perl5 or fast CPUs and added new
	tests for Relayed processing.

	Added the misc/mime subdirectory, containing a set of rules and
	a perl program to un-MIME all those nasty little messages carrying
	MIME attributes where they shouldn't or needn't...

	Four new files, if I trust the MANIFEST :-)

. Files changed:

	* agent/files/setup.cf: Can now say that a file is expected under
	some directory.  Applied that to mailbox, which is a file expected
	under maildrop.

	* agent/filter/environ.c: New get_env() routine, plus typo fixes. 
	Make sure new environment lines are smaller than MAX_STRING.

	* agent/filter/environ.h: Declared get_env().

	* agent/filter/io.c: Message is now read in a pool, instead of one
	big chunk.  Attempt to locate mailagent and perl.  Perform basic
	security checks on exec()ed programs.

	* agent/filter/logfile.c: Log onto stderr if logfile not opened
	correctly.

	* agent/filter/main.c: Use more portable real uid/gid setting.

	* agent/filter/misc.c: New my_exit() to allow exit code tracing for
	debugging.

	* agent/filter/msg.c: Call my_exit() instead of exit().

	* agent/filter/parser.c: Enhanced security checks performed on files.
	The _ character was not correctly parsed in variables.

	* agent/filter/parser.h: Declared exec_secure().

	* agent/magent.sh: Rule file path is now absolute, so caching can be
	safe.  Changed queue processing/sleeping logic for better
	interactivity.  New stat constants, and updated usage line.

	* agent/mailpatch.SH, agent/maildist.SH: Silently discard hostile
	addresses.  Added command forwarding support.

	* agent/mailhelp.SH: Silently discard hostile addresses.

	* agent/maillist.SH: Silently discard hostile addresses.  Knows about
	command forwarding.

	* agent/man/edusers.SH: Examples are now shown in constant-width font
	if possible.

	* agent/man/mailagent.SH: Examples are now shown in constant-width
	font if possible.  Big emphasis about security issues, for RUN
	commands & filter.  New Relayed: pseudo header computations. 
	Documented the %-H biffing macro with more details.  Updated my
	e-mail address.

	* agent/man/mailpatch.SH, agent/man/maildist.SH,
	agent/man/maillist.SH: Don't use expanded manpath in .so directives.

	* agent/man/mailhelp.SH: Documented command forwarding.

	* agent/man/package.SH: Examples are now shown in constant-width font
	if possible.  Mentions command forwarding.

	* agent/package.SH: Added command forwarding support.

	* agent/pl/actions.pl: Now reads 'help' as 'mailhelp' in command
	messages.  Locate and perform security checks on launched executables.

	* agent/pl/analyze.pl: Forgot to return 0 at the end of
	special_user().

	* agent/pl/biff.pl: Long header lines are now trimmed to 79 chars max.

	* agent/pl/cmdserv.pl: All power-sensitive actions can now be logged
	separately.  Launch sendmail only when session is done to avoid
	timeouts.  Perform security checks on all server commands.

	avoid malloc problems.  Now log the signal trapping even when invoked
	manually.

. Description:

	The email address listed in the README was wrong.

	Folder compression can now deal with various compressors.
	You may now compress folders using gzip if you want, or
	any other performant compression tool. This is configured
	via a compressors file listing the available compression tools,
	which are referred to by tags. You may choose the default tag
	to be used when compression a new folder. See the man page...
	Thanks to Kevin Johnson <kjj@pondscum.phx.mcd.mot.com> for
	contributing this code.

	Now escapes shell metacharacters for popen() on FORWARD and BOUNCE.
	This bug was reported by Larry W. Virden.

	It is now possible to force a strict locking procedure on
	folders by setting locksafe to ON. Mailagent will not attempt
	to deliver to a folder when it cannot grab the lock after
	the amount of retries you have configured. Alternatively,
	if you do both .lock and flock() locking, you can set locksafe
	to PARTIAL to let it go if at least one lock has been taken.
	Feature suggested by Larry W. Virden.

	New locksafe, compspecs and comptag config variables.

	Mailagent will now warn if it has been configured to do flock()
	but can't actually perform the operation because the system
	call is missing.

	Likewise, it will now make a note in the log when delivering to an
	unlocked folder, provided you have allowed it.

	Many typo fixes in the mailagent manual page, another contribution
	from Larry W. Virden.

	The &main'internet_info routine now assumes local user when facing
	a single login in the address. Otherwise, %A, %I and %O macros
	would not expand properly. Another set of thanks to Larry W. Virden
	for reporting this bug.

	One new file (compressors) installed in mailagent's private lib.

. Files changed:

	* agent/files/Jmakefile: New compressors file installed in the
	private library.

	* agent/files/compressors: Created.

	* agent/files/mailagent.cf: Added locksafe, compspecs and comptag
	config variables.  New "folder compression" section.

	* agent/files/setup.cf: Maildrop now defaults to the configured value
	at first install.  New compspecs optional file in configuration.

	* agent/magent.sh: Rewrote mbox_lock routine to deal with new
	locksafe variable.  Will now warn if configured to do flock() but
	can't actually.  Can now be configured to do safe or allow partial
	mbox locking.

	* agent/man/mailagent.SH: Folder compression can now deal with
	various compressors.  Added locksafe, compspecs and comptag config
	variables.  Many typo fixes.

	* agent/pl/actions.pl: Now escapes shell metacharacters for popen()
	on FORWARD and BOUNCE.  Will now make a note when delivering to an
	unlocked folder.  Saving will fail if mbox_lock returns an undefined
	value.

	* agent/pl/compress.pl: Can now handle compression with various
	compressors.  (code contributed by Kevin Johnson
	<kjj@pondscum.phx.mcd.mot.com>).

	* agent/pl/read_conf.pl: Added suitable defaults for compspec,
	comptag and locksafe.

	* agent/pl/rfc822.pl: Internet_info now assumes local user when
	facing a single login.

. Description:

	Fixed a nasty hole in the error recovery C filter program.
	Thanks to Rosina Bignall <bigna@leopard.cs.byu.edu> for
	having spotted it out.

	When facing an incorrect configuration causing the C filter
	to exit on a fatal error, the emergency saving routine was
	unable to save the message since it had not been read at
	that point. So we explicitely read the message now if it
	has not been done yet at that point!

	Following that fix, I have also arranged for the C filter
	output into .bak to be prefixed with the filter pid number,
	so that we can figure out where the message came from.

	Lastly, if the emergency saving is impossible, the message
	will be dumped on stdout. This was done in the shell filter,
	but not in the C filter. Hopefully, something catches the
	output from filter, if you set up your .forward according
	to the documentation.

	Internal C filter changes:
	. new routine write_fd() to write mail onto an opened file
	. write_file() now relies on new write_fd() to do its main job
	. read_stdin() was made a once routine
	. emergency_save() now attempts to read mail if not done already
	. emergency_save() will dump message on stdout as a fall back
	. now uses say() to print messages onto stderr
	. all messages on stderr now also include the filter pid
	. fatal() now prefixes its supplied reason with FATAL

	Forced numeric value when reading the Length header or mailagent
	could print an empty string instead of '0' when fed with an
	empty mail message (such as /dev/null).

	Escaped various dollars to avoid shell substitution in the
	mailagent.SH manual page. For those worried about that,
	mailagent-4.0 will probably have its documentation PODified,
	so this will become useless, hopefully.

. Files changed:

	* agent/filter/io.c: New routine write_fd() to write mail onto an
	opened file.  write_file() now relies on new write_fd() to do its
	main job.  read_stdin() was made a once routine.  emergency_save()
	now attempts to read mail if not done already.  emergency_save() will
	dump message on stdout as a fall back.

	* agent/filter/main.c: Now uses say() to print messages onto stderr.

	* agent/filter/msg.c: New routine say() to print messages onto
	stderr.  All messages on stderr now also include the filter pid. 
	Fatal() now prefixes its supplied reason with FATAL.

	* agent/filter/msg.h: Added declaration for new say() routine.

	* agent/filter/parser.c: Now uses say() to print messages on stderr.

	* agent/magent.sh: Forced numeric value when reading the Length
	header.

	* agent/man/mailagent.SH: Escaped various dollars to avoid shell
	substitution, grrr...

. Description:

	Forgot to return value in agent_lockfile(). Since the returned
	value is grabbed from whatever there is on the C stack at that
	point, you may get into trouble or go through this unharmed
	(which is what happened for me!).

. Files changed:

	* agent/filter/io.c: Forgot to return value in agent_lockfile().

. Description:

	Regenerated Configure with metaconfig 3.0 PL58.

	Updated my e-mail address in various manual patches, since it
	still pointed to my previous workplace.

	Signal that perl5.001m is known to work with that version of
	mailagent.

	Added support for locking on filesystems with short filenames.
	On flexible filesystems, locking is done with the standard
	.lock extension. On others, it is done by appending a '!'.
	Updating of .mh_sequences also knows about this limitation
	when constructing the new file.

	Avoid forking of a new mailagent if one is sitting in background.
	This is a trial fix for a seldom problem, which should not
	impact anyone. If you run many Command mail processing, this
	might improve things a little bit, on the occasion...

	Now remove mailagent's lock as soon as possible before exiting,
	to limit possible race conditions due to the above optimization.
	Note that a race condition did exist in previous versions, although
	it was very unlikely to occur in real life!

	New biffing configuration variables and new biffing features:
	It is now possible to remove leading comments in the body
	to only present new material, and also to perform a compaction
	on the body to present more of it in a limited space, sacrifying
	the original indentation of the message.

	New BIFF filtering command to dynamically configure biffing.

	Code fixes in the C filter:
	. Removed useless local variable declaration in C code.
	. Exported check_lock() for external mailagent lock checks in io.c
	. Commented and re-organized fatal code for emergency saving

	Forgot to define phostname, needed for NFS-secure locks in
	two mailagent utilities.

	Fixed syntax error when restoring previous option values.
	This should prevent the usual set of .bak errors that
	occurred only when perl5 was used. **NOTE**: This was fixed
	by an unofficial patch on the agent-users list. If you
	applied that patch, don't forget to restore the original
	file(s) before applying this official patch!

	Skip possible spaces before trailing command ';' terminator.
	This avoids syntax errors or problems when writing things
	like:
		SOME_COMMAND "argument"  ;
	i.e. when there are spaces after the final argument.

	New BIFF and BEEP regression testing

	One new file.

Tue Mar 21 14:08:38 MET 1995   Raphael Manfredi <ram@hptnos02.grenoble.hp.com>

. Description:

	Regenerated Configure to reflect my email address change. I moved
	from ACRI to HP, and my email is now: <ram@hptnos02.grenoble.hp.com>.
	The "critical" nature of this patch is due to that mere fix.

	Configure can now handle HP-UX broken WIFEXITED() macros. Indeed,
	on HP-UX, WIFEXITED(status) tries to cast the 'union wait status'
	into an int, which fails miserably. The new metaconfig symbol
	USE_WIFSTAT is now being used to avoid that.

	The README now reports that perl 5.0 PL1 does not work with
	mailagent, at least on my machine. For those adventurous enough
	to try it. Beware!!

	Added a Precedence: header to the sample vacation message.
	Mailagent does not add that to the header by default, since
	it is not mandatory at all. However, it is better to include
	one to avoid cascade of automatic replies after a vacation.

	Now creates the private library directory before installing,
	so that filter can be properly installed.

	Now allows spaces between header field name and the ':' delimiter.
	Strict RFC-822 does not forbid people from writing things like:
		From   : ram
		To     : ram
		Subject: test
	and therefore mailagent allows them and parses these fields
	correctly.

	Symbolic directories are now correctly followed. The new
	agent/pl/cdir.pl file is now used to derive relative paths
	from the symbolic directory location to follow links correctly.
	Previous versions were not following relative symbolic links,
	hence forcing people to have 'linkdirs: OFF' in their config.

	Fixed rename() syntax for perl 4.0 in the cmd/save.t test.

	One new file.

. Files changed:

	* agent/mailpatch.SH, agent/maildist.SH, agent/maillist.SH,
	agent/package.SH, agent/mailhelp.SH, agent/magent.sh,
	agent/edusers.SH: Added pl/cdir.pl to the list of appended files.

	* agent/filter/Jmakefile: Now creates the private library directory
	before installing.

	* agent/filter/io.c: Now relies on USE_WIFSTAT to use WIFEXITED() and
	friends.

	* agent/man/mailagent.SH: Sample vacation message now contains a
	Precedence: header.

	* agent/pl/cdir.pl: Created.

	* agent/pl/parse.pl: Now allows spaces between header field name and
	the ':' delimiter.

	* agent/pl/secure.pl: Symbolic directories are now correctly followed.

	* agent/test/cmd/save.t: Fixed rename() syntax for perl 4.0.

Thu Feb 16 15:56:50 MET 1995   Raphael Manfredi <ram@acri.fr>

. Description:

	Added new file setup.cf for initial configuration setup, via
	the -I switch. That new option greatly simplifies the initial
	configuration setup. If you run 'mailagent -I' with an
	existing ~/.mailagent, it will be "merged" with the current set
	of configuration variables (that is, new variables that were
	added after you initially configured mailagent, in subsequent
	patches). Your configuration is also checked for, to avoid
	nasty surprises at run-time...

	Forgot to add interfaces for BEEP and PROTECT, hence making
	it impossible to invoke those commands from a perl escape.

	Can now fake a missing From: line in header, unless prevented
	to do so by the new 'fromfake' config variable. That way, messages
	can be saved in MH folders even if the (local) sendmail did not
	bother adding a From: header, relying on the leading From envelope
	to identify the sender...

	Was not properly propagating rule-file variable definitions.
	Variables defined in rule files are dynamically scoped, as stated
	by the new paragraph in the manual page.

	New regression tests:
	. added test for the new -I switch
	. one more test for SAVE to check new fromfake feature
	. added checks for new fromfake config variable

	Regenerated Configure and config_h.SH with metaconfig 3.0 PL51.

	Three new files.

. Files changed:

	* agent/files/Jmakefile: Added new file setup.cf for initial
	configuration setup.

	* agent/pl/actions.pl: Now uses new header_append and header_prepend
	routines.

	* agent/pl/add_log.pl: New routine stdout_log for -I switch usage.

	* agent/test/option/I.t, agent/pl/install.pl: Created.

	* agent/pl/interface.pl: Forgot to add interfaces for BEEP and
	PROTECT.

	* agent/pl/parse.pl: New routines header_prepend and header_append. 
	Can now fake a missing From: line in header.

	* agent/pl/rules.pl: Was not properly propagating rule-file variable
	definitions.

	* agent/pl/sendfile.pl: Indentation fix.

	* agent/test/actions: One more test for SAVE to check new fromfake
	feature.

	* agent/test/cmd/save.t: Added checks for new fromfake config
	variable.

Fri Feb  3 19:16:07 MET 1995   Raphael Manfredi <ram@acri.fr>

. Description:

	Detab-ed the FAQ file for easier reading on terminals. I have
	resent a new version of it to Nancy for inclusion in her FAQ.

	Minor changes in FAQ wording. I added the Star Trek example to
	help understanding how filtering with regexps works.

	The C filter now avoids closing stdio files when they are not
	connected to a tty but rather redirected to a file. Otherwise,
	perl warnings and errors could never make it to the ~/.bak file,
	or whatever file you are redirecting errors to in ~/.forward.

	Mailagent was wrongly biffing when delivering to a mail hook.

	Avoid perl core dumps in &perl by localizing @_ on entry.
	When using the PERL command, I used to undef the @_ variable
	to ensure the perl script would get no garbage from there.
	However, Brian Dickson has found out that was a case of
	variable suicide, causing core dumps on SUNs. He proposed
	using local() to avoid the nasty side effect.

	Ensure domain name matches are made after the '@' delimiter
	when looking for "close" addresses. It used to think that
	addresses like ram@soft.user.acri.fr and ram@soft.user.acri
	where equivalent, because the match was not anchored to '@'.

	Order of arguments was wrong when calling &spawn, to run
	the callout queue. Also, it could loop forever in &run when
	flushing the whole queue and the value of first_callout time
	was not set right the first time a callout is queued. All
	those bugs nailed down thanks to a bug report from 
	Randal L. Schwartz on agent-users.

	Rule parsing could end-up prematurely when facing hook files,
	because the parser was testing for an empty string instead
	of undefinedness, which would abruptly end the parsing when
	facing a blank line in a hook since final \n are chopped off.

	Avoid blank printing when the default rule was never applied
	in mailagent stastistics summary printing.

	Fixed regexp bug that could lead the UMASK test to fail when
	the word 'mail' was appearing in the path leading to the
	place where mailagent sources are stored! Again, thanks to
	Brian Dickson and Eric M. Carroll for reporting it and
	nailing it down, at last!

. Files changed:

	* FAQ: Detab-ed the FAQ file for easier reading on terminals.  Minor
	changes in wording and added the Star Trek example.

	* agent/filter/io.c: Avoid closing stdio files if not connected to a
	tty.

	* agent/filter/parser.c: Moved definition of S_IWOTH and S_IWGRP to
	the top.

	* agent/magent.sh: Also select hot piping on stderr to avoid problems
	on fork.

	* agent/pl/actions.pl: Was wrongly biffing when delivering to a mail
	hook.  Avoid perl core dumps in &perl by localizing @_ on entry.

	* agent/pl/addr.pl: Ensure domain name matches are made after the '@'
	delimiter.

	* agent/pl/callout.pl: Order of arguments was wrong when calling
	&spawn.  Could loop forever in &run when flushing the whole queue. 
	Value of first_callout time was not set right the first time.  Added
	more debugging information.

	* agent/pl/lexical.pl: Rule parsing could end-up prematurely when
	facing hook files.

	* agent/pl/rules.pl: Added tracing of alternate rules to help debug
	their parsing.

	* agent/pl/stats.pl: Avoid blank printing when the default rule was
	never applied.

	* agent/test/cmd/umask.t: Fixed regexp bug that could lead the test
	to fail.

Wed Jan 25 16:44:40 MET 1995   Raphael Manfredi <ram@acri.fr>

. Description:

	Regenerated Configure with metaconfig 3.0 PL48 for install
	binary lookup.

	Regenerated most Makefile.SH files with jmake 3.0 PL48 to
	benefit from the install lookup.

	Extended copyright notice to include year 1995.

	Mailagent now works with perl 5.0. It has been fully tested on
	my DEC OSF/1 3.0 machine and passes all its regression tests.
	However, this perl 5.0 is a version patched with early
	patches from the perl5-porters list. See the README file for
	instructions about how to get those patches.

	New option letter 't' for mailagent -s. The 'mailagent -surat'
	command will only deliver statistics for the top-level rule file.
	Indeed, each time your rule file changes, mailagent normally
	starts a new set of statistics on top of older ones.

	New commands BEEP and PROTECT. The BEEP command controls the new
	%a macro for biffing message, which is expanded into the matching
	amount of ^G characters. The PROTECT commands lets you define
	file protections for newly created folders.

	I also added support for the Msg-Protect MH profile component
	when saving into an MH folder, at Eric M. Carroll's request.
	However, the new PROTECT command can override the default Msg-Protect
	specification from your ~/.mh_profile.

	Added support for NFS bug on remote read-only folders. Indeed, SUN's
	NFS running on SUN 4.1.2 was allowing a remote write to a read-only
	folder lying on my DEC OSF/1 3.0 machine...

	Destination address for PROCESS is now parsed correctly, by using
	the RFC822 parser instead of a local hacked parsing.

	Ported many files to perl 5.0 PL0. This included workarounds for
	perl 5.0 bugs, and lots of @ escaping in strings and patterns,
	mainly in the regression test suite.

	Avoid problems on slow machines in test mode for queue timestamps.
	Some slow machines were reported to fail some tests in option/l.
	I made sure those will not occur any more by twiddling with the
	queue output string in test mode.

	UNSEEN mark in log has the home directory stripped via &tilda.

	Two new files.

. Files changed:

	* agent/man/mailagent.SH: New option letter 't' for mailagent -s. 
	New commands BEEP and PROTECT.  New macro %a for biff messages.

	* agent/pl/actions.pl: Added support for NFS bug on remote read-only
	folders.  Destination address for PROCESS is now parsed correctly. 
	Added support for folder mode change, as defined by PROTECT.

	* agent/pl/biff.pl: New macro %a for variable bells, under the
	control of BEEP.

	* agent/pl/filter.pl: New commands BEEP and PROTECT.

	* agent/pl/getdate.pl: Fixed a typo in &yyerror and various code
	clean-up.  Ported to perl 5.0 PL0.

	* agent/pl/lexical.pl: Added automatic @ escape in patterns for perl
	5.0.

	* agent/pl/listqueue.pl: Avoid problems on slow machines in test mode
	for queue timestamps.

	* agent/test/cmd/vacation.t, agent/test/cmd/notify.t,
	agent/pl/parse.pl, agent/pl/queue_mail.pl, agent/test/misc/compress.t,
	, agent/test/cmd/message.t, agent/pl/macros.pl: Ported to perl 5.0
	PL0.

	* agent/pl/mh.pl: Added support for the Msg-Protect MH profile
	component.  Allows new PROTECT command to override default
	Msg-Protect.  UNSEEN mark in log has the home directory stripped via
	&tilda.

	* agent/pl/mmdf.pl: New routine &chmod for folder permission settting.

	* agent/pl/read_conf.pl: Escape all @ in config file for perl 5.0.

	* agent/pl/rulenv.pl: New routines &unset and &undef.  Added default
	values for PROTECT and BEEP.  Added logs in case of eval errors for
	perl 5.0.

	* agent/pl/runcmd.pl: New commands PROTECT and BEEP.

	* agent/pl/signals.pl: Put signal handler names into double quotes
	for perl 5.0.

	* agent/pl/stats.pl: Now supports 't' to track only top-most rule
	file stats.

	* agent/pl/usrmac.pl: Ported to perl 5.0 PL0.  Added eval error
	tracking for perl 5.0.

	* agent/test/actions: Extended rules for the PROTECT command tests.

	* agent/test/basic/config.t: Now sets a default umask in the
	configuration.

	* agent/test/cmd/protect.t, agent/test/cmd/beep.t: Created.

	* agent/test/misc/mh.t: Added checks for Msg-Protect and PROTECT.

Tue Jan 03 19:36:49 MET 1995   Raphael Manfredi <ram@acri.fr>

. Description:

	Upgraded Configure with metaconfig 3.0 PL44

	C filter now correctly includes <sys/fcntl.h> as a last option only.

	Added a -V option to filter to print out the version and patchlevel.
	This is not documented anywhere but in the code. Sorry, but there is
	no manual page for filter. This is only for the C filter though, the
	shell filter can be "edited" to get its version number.

	No longer uses agent/pl/umask.pl. This file is to be removed from
	your local copy if you still have it around.

	New -u option for ANNOTATE: the annotation will only be performed
	if the specified header is not already present in the message.

	Fixed example on the shell server command: power checking was too
	restrictive by requiring the user to only hold the 'shell' power
	where he may hold many others at the same time...

	Removed quotes for the argument of SERVER -d to accomodate new option
	parsing. Be careful! You must now say SERVER -d cmd1,cmd2 etc.., with
	no spaces around the separating commas.

	Added a -l switch to VACATION and extended its arguments. When -l
	is used, modification are only made within the scope of the rule.
	It is also possible to specify an alternate vacation file, and even
	change the vacation period, locally or for the remaining of the
	parsing...

	New section in the man page documenting Rule Environment variables.

	Removed old broken umask handling (now a part of rule env). The new
	code should work much better and is more generic.

	The %=config variables were not properly substituted. They were
	probably expanded into spaces instead.

	It is no longer possible to get at the vacation variable from
	a new user-defined command. You must get at the $env'vacation
	variable instead (see the Rule Environment section in the manual
	page).

	Mailagent no longer tries to read the rule cache when none was
	configured from ~/.mailagent...

	Added generic option parsing code for easier extensions. As a matter
	of fact, the code was simplified internally. Routines implementing
	actions now have the leading action name chopped of the $cms string,
	as well as possible options. The action routine also directly get
	at the resulting argument string, which simplifies processing for
	most of the commands... This should not impact performances, and
	may in fact degrade them a little since we now make use of eval()
	more heavily.

	Make sure old utmp list is gone when reloading from /etc/utmp.

	Added new tests for ANNOTATE -u and VACATION -l.

	Removed agent/pl/umask.pl from distribution, as stated before.

	Three new files, including an FAQ document, an exerpt of the
	"Filtering Mail FAQ" posting from Nancy McGough.

. Files changed:

	* FAQ, agent/pl/rulenv.pl, agent/pl/options.pl: Created.

	* agent/pl/umask.pl: Removed from the distribution.

	* agent/filter/lock.c: Now correctly includes <sys/fcntl.h> as a last
	option only.

	* agent/filter/main.c: Added a -V option to print out the version and
	patchlevel.

	* agent/magent.sh: New library files pl/rulenv.pl and pl/options.pl
	included.  No longer uses pl/umask.pl.

	* agent/man/mailagent.SH: New -u option for ANNOTATE documented. 
	Fixed example on the shell server command (power checking).  Removed
	quotes for SERVER -d to accomodate new option parsing.  Added a -l
	switch to VACATION and extended its arguments.  New section
	documenting Rule Environment variables.

	* agent/pl/actions.pl: Removed a here-doc string to workaround a bug
	in perl 4.0 PL36.  Simplified action codes to use new opt'sw_xxx
	option vars.  &execute_command no longer sleeps before resuming
	parent process.

	* agent/pl/analyze.pl: Now makes use of rule environment vars from
	the env package.  Removed old broken umask handling (now a part of
	rule env).

	* agent/pl/eval.pl: Simplified hash table initialization -- code
	still unused.

	* agent/pl/filter.pl: Commands now get a string with the command name
	chopped off.  Modified &alter_execution to accomodate new option
	parsing.

	* agent/pl/hook.pl: Routine &perl now calls &main'perl directly to do
	its job.  No longer pre-extend variable when reading top 128 bytes.

	* agent/pl/macros.pl: The %=config variables were not properly
	substituted.

	* agent/pl/newcmd.pl: It is no longer possible to get at the vacation
	variable.

	* agent/pl/rules.pl: Don't try to read the rule cache when none was
	configured.

	* agent/pl/runcmd.pl: Added generic option parsing code for easier
	extensions.  Chops off the action name and options before calling
	handler.

	* agent/pl/utmp/utmp_pl.sh: Make sure old utmp list is gone when
	reloading from /etc/utmp.

	* agent/test/actions: Added new tests for ANNOTATE -u and VACATION -l.

	* agent/test/basic/config.t: Temporary directory is now local, don't
	clobber /tmp.

	* agent/test/cmd/annotate.t: Added tests for new -u option.

	* agent/test/cmd/vacation.t: Added tests for new -l option and
	extended parameters.

	* misc/shell/shell: Power checking was not correctly performed (was
	too restrictive).

	* misc/unkit/unkit.pl: Now uses cf'email for the notification
	address.  Fixed a typo in sv_kfrom variable spelling.

Mon Oct 31 12:20:39 MET 1994   Raphael Manfredi <ram@acri.fr>

. Description:

	File magent.sh now replaces magent.SH to avoid auto-extraction
	by Configure. Indeed, magent.sh relies on the presence of the
	agent/pl/utmp.pl file, which is not available at Configure
	time, usually. Since Configure only extacts .SH files automagically,
	this is a way to ensure the file will be built according to make
	rules, i.e. only once agent/pl/utmp.pl has been created will we
	attempt to run /bin/sh magent.sh.

. Files changed:

	* agent/Jmakefile: File magent.sh now replaces magent.SH to avoid
	auto-extraction.

Sat Oct 29 19:35:00 MET 1994   Raphael Manfredi <ram@acri.fr>

. Description:

	The shell filter now behaves more like the C filter. It will
	print roughly the same messages in the log under normal conditions,
	which includes QUEUED-like messages that did not appear before.
	[I don't normally use the shell filter on my machine but I did test
	it for a while to make sure it was not broken. That's why I decided
	to make its output similar to the C filter to avoid surprises
	when glancing at the log file].

	Added built-in biffing support, by popular demand. Actually, no,
	it is to please my officemate who wrote a set of scripts to achieve
	the same thing, only to see that they were failing when he was not
	logged in. It's really straightforward to set up and to configure.
	Please refer to the new MAIL BIFFING section on the manual page
	for details.

	Notifications sent by the package command are now directed to the
	user specified on the command, not to the return address since it
	is not an error, and the two might differ.

	Internet numbers in message IDs are now allowed. If you don't use
	UNIQUE nor RECORD commands, then you don't care about that
	anyway.

	Added support for local (internal) macro overriding, which is used
	by the biffing mechanism to override macros like %f or %D. It is
	possible for the overrider to let the user get to the standard
	macro set by providing:
		:	\02!
	at the end of the string passed to &macro'overload. This will allow
	%:f to be taken as the "standard" %f macro. Note that this is an
	internal feature and is not documented in the manual page. I'm merely
	mentionning it here in case you wish to use that in your own commands.

	Updated Configure with metaconfig 3.0 PL43, merely to fix a vicious
	'tr' bug when attempting to translate case to/from lower to upper on
	machines with a non-ascii character set. This was reported to me by
	Andreas Sahlbach <a.sahlbach@tu-bs.de>.

	From now on, the ChangeLog file will record changes made to the
	distribution. The text you are reading now is also part of the
	ChangeLog file, as well as the list of changed files, with their
	RCS logs. That should help users track modifications better.

	8 new files in the distribution, for utmp.pl support and biffing.

. Files changed:

	* agent/Jmakefile: Directory pl added to subdirs and depend lists.

	* agent/files/filter.sh: Made it behave more like the C filter.

	* agent/files/mailagent.cf: Six new configuration variables for
	biffing support.

	* agent/magent.SH: Added built-in biffing support.

	* agent/man/mailagent.SH: Documents the six new config variables for
	biffing.  New section dedicated to built-in mail biffing.

	* agent/package.SH: Notifications now sent to the user, not the
	return address.

	* agent/pl/utmp/Jmakefile, agent/pl/Jmakefile, agent/pl/biff.pl,
	agent/pl/utmp/utmp_ph.c, agent/pl/utmp/utmp_pl.sh: Created.

	for %.  Added support for local (internal) macro overriding.
