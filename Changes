This file shortly documents the new features appearing in mailagent 3.0
compared to mailagent 2.9 PL19. For more details, please refer to the manual
page [yes, it's getting bigger and bigger, sorry].

. Mailhook disappears. Folder hooks are now handled without the need for an
  extra process.

. NOTIFY now takes its FIRST argument to indicate the message file,
  instead of its LAST as in the 2.9 release. This change in order to make
  it compatible with MESSAGE.

. Mailagent secure configuration checks. Impossible to use mailagent if the
  ~/.mailagent file or the rule file are not correctly protected.

. Dynamic loading interface (dynload.pl) available for perl commands.

. Added a generic command server. Mailagent provides the server engine and
  users write their own commands, with special provision for perl scripts
  which can be directly loaded and executed within mailagent itself.

. User-defined macro support %-(x) and perl interface.

. New APPLY, REQUIRE, SERVER, MACRO commands.

. Support for rule caching. This avoids recompiling large rule files at every
  mailagent run, but speed has never never been a main concern in this program
  anyway.

. Negated mode support <!MODE>. Rule is not executed if in the specified
  negated mode. This supersedes normal modes, i.e. <MODE, !MODE> is never
  executed.

. Can now configure sendmail process and inews, with options, from ~/.mailagent.
  If your sendmail behaves strangely or want to have interactive delivery
  instead of queuing, this is the place to look at.

. New usr_log facility, enabling user-defined logfiles. Available for your
  own commands and used internally by mailagent.

. Saving operations now check on the size of the produced folder for NFS.

. Can now access ~/.mailagent config params via %=var

. Fixed bug in agent queue parsing. This happened mainly on SUN systems, and
  was apparently a perl fileglob bug (or is it a /bin/csh bug?). Anyway, I
  now use readdir() to access the queue, which suppresses forking of an extra
  process.

. Improved RFC822 address parsing. Now understands group names as login names.

. Output for mailagent -d formatted differently.

. Selector range Body <1,4>: available. This example selects body lines 1 to
  4 (inclusive) for matching.

. Can now deliver to MH folders (without the need for an extra process). Use
  'SAVE +foo' to deliver to the MH folder foo. Unseen sequences specified in
  your ~/.mh_profile are correctly updated.

. Minimal support for directory hooks (only behaves like MH folders currently).

. New @SH package command for dist-3.0 MailAuthor.U support. That metaconfig
  units sends a mail in specific format to record users of some package, and
  the package command is there to automate the process.
