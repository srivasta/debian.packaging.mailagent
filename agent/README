This is the root directory for mailagent.

If you choose to install the mailagent, you will enable people to
ask for patches and eventually distributions. You need kit 2.0
(at least PL 9) and cshar 3.0 for the mailagent's PROCESS command to
work properly. If you miss one of those, you can grab them my
CPAN directory: http://search.cpan.org/search?author=RAM

You will also have access to filtering abilities, specified using
lex-like rules. The mailagent will delete all those mails you do not
wish to read, forward others (e.g. rebroadcasting a mailing list),
and file mail into folders for delayed reading.

Instructions for configuring and setting your mailagent are found
in the manual page. Once all is installed, run "man mailagent".
You can also go to the man/ subdirectory and run the following:
"nroff -man mailagent.1 | more -s".

Look at the README file in the filter/ directory for hints on choosing
between the C or the shell version of the filter.
