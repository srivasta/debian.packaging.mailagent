This directory contains examples of rule files for the mailagent and
other aspects from my own environment.

daemon:
	A small rule file which basically simulates the behaviour of the
	vacation program (except that vacation messages are sent every day,
	not once).

mailfolders:
	This file is a copy of my ~/.mailfolders. It lists all the folders or
	directories where the filter drops its incoming mail (appart from my
	system mailbox, which is implicetely included). This file is used by
	my ~/.profile to compute a suitable MAILPATH value (a colon separated
	list of files ksh should monitor for new mail). It is also used by the
	mchk script.

mchk:
	Check all the folders for new mail.

mhinc:
	This script incorporates the filtered mails or news into the
	corresponding MH folder.
	
nocmds:
	A copy of my ~/tmp/nocmds file, which will be mailed back to anybody
	who sends me a Command mail, except when sent by myself.

profile:
	An excerpt from my ~/.profile file where the mail related variables
	are set. I am using ksh, but some plain sh also handle those variables,
	which is why it is not in a ~/.kshrc.

rules:
	The rule file I am currently using as of today, June 30th 1992. It is
	a good example of what can be done, although it is far from using all
	the available features. Heavily commented.

vacation:
	A generic vacation message held in ~/.vacation. It shows typical macro
	substitutions.
