Dear %N:

I have received your command mail dated %[Date].

I am truly sorry, but the mailagent access has been denied to you for various
reasons. Your mail however was not lost but filtered normally, which means
I will have a look at it. I may eventually execute the command myself, if
necessary and needed.

Thank you for your understanding.
