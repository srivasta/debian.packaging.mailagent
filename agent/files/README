This directory holds the shell version of the filter, and some other
sample files which will be installed in the public mailagent directory.

agenthelp:
	The generic help message used by the @SH mailhelp command. You may
	of course rewrite this completely to fit your taste.

chkagent.sh:
	A small script I am using to monitor the whole mailagent installation.
	This is run by cron every night, and mails me problems logged in the
	log file, or unusual messages from my ~/.bak, etc...
	(The name chkagent.sh was chosen to leave room for the RCS ,v extension
	on some old systems with 14 characters limit in the file names.)
	Here is my crontab entry:

		# Check the mailagent log file for the current day
		55 23 * * *		$HOME/etc/checkagent

commands:
	This file holds the allowed commands for @SH hooks.

distribs:
	A description table which states where each program is located,
	whether it is archived or not, or has patches, etc... This is
	used by the @SH commands.

filter.sh:
	The shell version of the filter program. Note that this script is
	not tested by the automatic regression tests and needs some tailoring
	before it can be used. It is provided only as a guideline for people
	who cannot use the C version.

mailagent.cf:
	A template for your ~/.mailagent.

proglist:
	A list of program description which will be used by the 'maillist'
	command.
