#
#
# This table list all the compressors and their associated decompressors
# that may be used by mailagent to. They are referenced by their tag name
# which is the first word on each line.
#
# Extensions listed should be unique amongst the file, since they are
# used to determine how a compressed folder was generated. Folders
# whose compression type is derived that way are re-compressed using
# the same tagged compressor.
#
# You may add or change any compressor definition within this file to suit
# your local needs.
#
# This file is formatted with tabstops set to 4 characters. Items in the row
# must be separated with TABS, to allow spaces within command strings.
