NAME

	approve -- Approves command in advance by specifying a password

SYNOPSIS

	approve password command

DESCRIPTION

This command records the specified password in the environment and then
launches the command given as argument.

It is entirely up to the command to check the approve variable when it
otherwise expects a password, otherwise this command has no visible
effect.

It is not currently possible to approve a command which collects input.

EXAMPLE

	approve list-password subscribe agent-users ram@acri.fr
!NO!SUBS!
chmod 644 approve
