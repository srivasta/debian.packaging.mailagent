NAME

	getauth -- Gets power clearance file

SYNOPSIS

	getauth power [password]

DESCRIPTION

This command requests the power clearance file for the specified power. The
power password is optional if the power is already detained or the user has
already got the 'system' power.

To get the 'root' or 'security' clearances, you need the corresponding
power.

EXAMPLE

	getauth list-power mypasswd
!NO!SUBS!
chmod 644 getauth
