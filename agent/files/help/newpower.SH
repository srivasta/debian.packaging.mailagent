NAME

	newpower -- Adds a new power to the system

SYNOPSIS

	newpower power password [alias]
	... users ...
	EOF

DESCRIPTION

This command creates a new server power and assigns a password to protect it.
If the power name is longer than 12 characters, you may specify an alias for
that power, which will be used internally by mailagent to reference it, or
leave the field blank and mailagent will generate one for you.

The 'system' power is normally required to create a new power. The 'security'
power is required to create the root power and the 'root' power is needed to
create 'security'. In order to bootstrap either power, please refer to the
mailagent manual page where this is explained in detail.

EXAMPLE

	newpower list-power mypasswd
	ram@acri.fr
	ram@eiffel.com
	EOF
!NO!SUBS!
chmod 644 newpower
