NAME

	remauth -- Removes users from power clearance file

SYNOPSIS

	remauth name [password]
	... list of users ...
	EOF

DESCRIPTION

This command removes specified users from the power's clearance file. No
special power is required when the target power is already detained. Otherwise
the 'system' power is needed.

As usual, 'root' and 'security' clearances require the corresponding power to
be held or the appropriate password.

Only users matching exactly the addresses listed in the clearance file will
be removed.

EXAMPLE

	remauth list list-password
	root@acri.fr
	EOF
!NO!SUBS!
chmod 644 remauth
