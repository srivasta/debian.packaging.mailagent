NAME

	set -- Sets a command environment variable

SYNOPSIS

	set variable value

DESCRIPTION

This command sets the variable to the specified value. Flags are only
set to 'true' or 'false', although 'on', 'yes' and an empty value are
also recognized to be 'true', anything else being 'false'.

A 'set' all by itself will list all the defined variables along with
their values.

EXAMPLES

	set eof END_OF_FILE
	set trace on
	set
!NO!SUBS!
chmod 644 set
