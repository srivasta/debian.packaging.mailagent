NAME

	setauth -- Replaces current clearance file

SYNOPSIS

	setauth name [password]
	... list of users ...
	EOF

DESCRIPTION

This command sets the clearance file for the target power. No special power is
required when the target power is already detained. Otherwise the 'system'
power is needed.

As usual, 'root' and 'security' clearances require the corresponding power to
be held or the appropriate password.

EXAMPLE

	setauth root root-password
	ram@acri.fr
	EOF
!NO!SUBS!
chmod 644 setauth
