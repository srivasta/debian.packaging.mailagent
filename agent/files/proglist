# Small descriptions for programs

* cshar
The useful shell-archive maker. I modified the original
slightly to add a Configure script.
---

* kit
A simple binary tarmailer. This is used by the mail agent when
mailing big sets of files. You presently need cshar (from
Rich Salz) to use kit.
---

* dist
Larry Wall's dist package, modified. It contains:
    - metaconfig, a Configure script generator
    - a patch generator
    - a distribution maker
It comes from version Larry's dist 2.0 PL 2 package, but has
quite a few extensions (I worked especially on the patch
generating tools and metaconfig itself). The units used by
metaconfig have been manually ripped off from some recently
posted Configure scripts (elm 2.3, perl 3.0).
---

* matrix
An object-oriented matrix library. It is a beta-test release.
---

* file
The file(1) command with lots of /etc/magic entries. Useful
when you work with NFS on different architectures as you
can have your own magic file.
---

* rcs
GNU Revision Control System. You need RCS to use Larry's
dist package (patch generating tools).
---

* cops
Security analysis tools. May be useful to find holes in
your system.
---

* xfmt
Simple text formatter. You need flex to compile it.
It looks like SUN-OS fmt program.
---

* less
The pager that is more than more(1).
---

* flex
Fast lex. Needed for the xfmt package, because lex is not
powerful enough.
---

* et
Error table compiler (from MIT).
---

* undel
Replacement for rm(1). Marks files for deletion instead of
removing them. You need the et package for version 2.0 to
compile.
---

* dither
Displays a color image on a two-level display (White and black).
Uses a non-standard picture format in input and output
(that's mine ! :-)).
---

* perl
Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language. It
combines the best features of C, awk, sed and sh.
You need it to use the dist package.
---

* patch
The useful utility to apply diff files on a distribution. You could
of course apply them by hand, but it may well be a long procedure !
Written by Larry Wall.
