.SH NAME
edusers \- edit users list created by package
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBedusers\fR [\fIsystem\fR [\fIversion\fR]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This command lets you safely edit the \fIusers\fR list created by the
.I package
command. It locks the file before launching the editor, hence protecting
against any concurrent update by some \fIpackage\fR command that could
arrive at the same time (by e-mail). The level of protection this locking
buys you depends on the locking policy you have configured in
your \fI~/.mailagent\fR.
.PP
If you are within a package source tree, all you need to say is
.Ex
edusers
.Ef
to edit the \fIusers\fR file for that package. In order for that particular
feature to work properly, the package must have been placed under dist control,
or at least the \fIpackinit\fR command from the dist package must have been
run.
.PP
Otherwise, you may specify
a system name, and optionally a version number if that is not enough to
disambiguate. Using '-' will get you the lattest version available.
.PP
In any case, there must be a proper setting of the \fIdistribs\fR file
to use this command. If that file is not accurate, the \fIpackage\fR
command will not be able to produce a \fIusers\fR file anyway.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The editor is taken out of the EDITOR variable if defined, then from
the VISUAL variable, defaulting to
.I $defeditor
if none of the variables is set.
.SH FILES
.PD 0
