;#
;# Logging facilities. Normally, logs are appended into the agentlog file by
;# a call to &add_log. For plain mailagent actions, this is fine. However,
;# when user-defined commands are run or when the generic server is used, it
;# could be desirable to write the logs to some other file.
;#
;# Therefore, this package provides a generic logging interface (usr_log) while
;# keeping the previous add_log routine for backward compatibility. The user
;# may record alternative log files, with or without a copy to the global log.
;#
;# The following interface functions in the usrlog package are available:
;#
;#   . new(name, file, flag)
;#       records a log file. If flag is true, a copy to the main log
;#       is also written. The name parameter refers to the global name
;#       under which the log is known from now on. If an existing log file
;#       has already been defined under this name, nothing is done.
;#   . delete(name)
;#       deletes a log file by name.
;#
;# All files given as a relative path name (i.e. not starting with /) are
;# rooted in the 'logdir' directory as defined in the ~/.mailagent file.
;#
;# To log something, the user calls:
;#
;#   . usr_log(name, string)
;#
;# The logfile name 'default' is reserved to refer to the default system-wide
;# logfile. Trying to log something to a non-existent logfile will log to the
;# default logfile instead.
;#
# Add an entry to logfile
# There is no need to lock logfile as print is sandwiched betweeen
# an open and a close (kernel will flush at the end of the file).
sub add_log {
	# Indirection needed, so that we may remap add_log on stderr_log via a
	# type glob assignment.
	&usrlog'write_log($cf'logfile, $_[0], undef);
}

# When mailagent is used interactively, log messages are also printed on
# the standard error.
# NB: this function is not called directly, but via a type glob *add_log.
sub stderr_log {
	print STDERR "$prog_name: $_[0]\n";
	&usrlog'write_log($cf'logfile, $_[0], undef);

# duplicated into the logfile. Used solely by &cf'setup.
