;# This package implements a callout queue for a limited "at" support in
;# mailagent commands. Since items in the callout queue can only be dispatched
;# by another call to the mailagent command, execution at an exact time cannot
;# be guaranteed; instead we say the action will be launched "after" a certain
;# date.
;#
;# It is quite admissible, however, to schedule a periodic cron job launching
;# a 'mailagent -q' command to actually force processing of the queue and also
;# of the callout queue, as a side effect... This is up to you, the user, to
;# ensure that, depending on the required accuracy for your AFTER commands.
;#
;# The callout queue is handled as a sorted list with a single text file:
;#
;#   <timestamp> <type> <filename> <command>
;#
;# where:
;#  - timestamp is the time in seconds elapsed since the Epoch, after which
;#    the job should be launched.
;#  - type is either 'agent' or 'shell' depending on whether the command is
;#    a shell command or a mailagent filtering command (which can be a possible
;#    mailagent call back to a perl routine via DO).
;#  - command is the command to be run. Everything up to the new line.
;#
;# When loaded in memory, the callout queue is held in three hash tables:
;#  %Calltype: associates a timestamp to a list of ^@-separated types
;#  %Callout: associates a timestamp to a list of ^@-separated actions
;#  %Callfile: associates a timestamp with a list of file names
;# This separation by means of ^@ is necessary since more than one event may
;# be associated to a single point in time.
