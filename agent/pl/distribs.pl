;# Revision 3.0  1993/11/29  13:48:40  ram
;# Baseline for mailagent 3.0 netwide release.
;#
;#
;# This file relies on the following external conditions:
;#    - operation &fatal() available for fatal errors
;#    - the configuration variables are properly set
;#    - logging is done via &add_log()
;#
# Read a distribution file and fill in data structures for
# the query functions. All the data are stored in associative
# arrays, indexed by the system's name and version number.
# Associative arrays are:
#
# name          indexed by       information
#
# %Program      name + version   have we seen that line ?
# %System       name             is name a valid system ?
# %Version      name             latest version for system
# %Location		name + version   location of the distribution
# %Archived     name + version   is distribution archived ?
# %Compressed   name + version   is archive compressed ?
# %Patch_only   name + version   true if only patches delivered
# %Maintained   name + version   true if distribution is maintained
# %Patches      name + version   true if official patches available
#
# For systems with a version of '---' in the file, the version
# for accessing the data has to be a "0" string.
#
# Expected format for the distribution file:
#     system version location archive compress patches
#
# The `archive', `compress' and `patches' fields can take one
# of the following states: "yes" and "no". An additional state
# for `patches' is "old", which means that only patches are
# available for the version, and not the distribution. Another is
# "patch" which means that official patches are available.
# All these states can be abbreviated with the first letter.
