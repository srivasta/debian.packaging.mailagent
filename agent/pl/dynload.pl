;# Dynamic loading of a file into a given package, with a few extra features,
;# like having the private mailagent lib prepended automatically to the @INC
;# array. The %Loaded array records the files which have already been loaded
;# so that we do not load the same file twice. The key records the package
;# name and then the file, separated by a ':'.
;#
;# Additionally, the &do routine can be given an argument of the form:
;#    package'routine
;#    COMMAND:package'routine
;#    file:package'routine
;# and would then call &load with the proper arguments. Of course, in the first
;# case, nothing is to be done but to check that the routine is already there.
;# The second and third case enable loading of a routine from a specific file,
;# of from a file defining a new command. Distinction is made by looking at
;# the commands first, which should not be the source of too many conflicts
;# when a path with '/' is given...

# Inspect their request closely, trying to guess what they really want. The
# general pattern they can give us is:
#     something:routine
# where something may be a command name or a path name, or may be missing
# entirely up to the ':' separator, and routine is a qualified or unqualified
# routine name, using the single quote as package separator, and not :: as in
# perl5 or C++ -- I loathe that token, maybe because I loathe C++ so much?
# Returns success condition, or undef if file cannot be loaded (missing?).

	# at $something, we might be able to find out where that routine might
	# be found... First check whether it is the name of a user-defined command
	# in which case we load that file and get the command. Otherwise, the
	# remaining is taken as a path where the routine may be found.
