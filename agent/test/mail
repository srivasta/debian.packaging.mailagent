Your message to the moderated usenet group comp.compilers has been
received.  Within a few days, it should either be posted to usenet or, if
for some reason it's not suitable for posting, returned to you.

When you send a message to comp.compilers, I understand that to mean that
you want me to post it to usenet, which means it will be sent to tens of
thousands of potential readers at thousands of computers all around the
world.  It may also appear in a printed comp.compilers annual and other
books, in the ACM SIGPLAN Notices and other magazines, in on-line and
off-line archives, CD-ROMs, and anywhere else that some reader decides to
use it.

If you don't want me to post something, please send it instead to
compilers-request@iecc.cambridge.ma.us.

Regards,
John Levine, comp.compilers moderator
