This is a first line of pure ASCII text
This second line contains the word 'Rapha=EBl'
This third line is much longer than 76 chars and therefore needs to be brok=
en up smartly
This fourth line contains the naughty char '=3D'!
This fifth line is unreadable: =E0=E9=F4=EA=E8=E0=E9=F4=EA=E8=E0=E9=F4=EA=
=E8=E0=E9=F4=EA=E8=E0=E9=F4=EA=E8=E0=E9=F4=EA=E8=E0=E9=F4=EA=E8, yeah!
