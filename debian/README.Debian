This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of Raphael Manfredi's
mailagent program.

This version of mailagent was put together by Manoj Srivastava
<srivasta@datasync.com>, from the sources distributed directly by the
author, Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>, at:

       http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=dist&query=mailagent

The changes in this package are essentially the addition of support for 
the Debian package maintenance scheme, by adding various debian.* files. 
The changes in the default configuration are using the pager /bin/more,
and using /usr/bin/ae as the default editor, since these programs are 
guaranteed to be present in any debian system.  The other changes are
to ensure that a .config directory is present, so that no mail message
is sent to the maintainer while building the debian package.  An over-
ride file is also used to ensure that installation occurs into a local
debian-tmp directory, required to build the debianized version. 

The "getcost" program found in the original sources under misc/getcost
was not included in the package, due to the restriction imposed by the
original "getcost" author (not Raphael Manfredi).  The program can
nonetheless be found in the original sources.
