  * New upstream release.
    + Do not propagate Followup-To headers via POST, unless the value is
      "poster". Indeed, INN2 will reject the article if the newsgroup
      listed there is invalid.
    + Be more picky about message IDs used for news: ensure there is but
      one "@".
    + Be even stricter with X- headers in POST: only let a few selected
      ones through.
    + Have POST strip more headers from the message, since INN2 will reject
      the message anyway if they are present.

mailagent (1:3.1-24-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. After a long time, mailagent has revived. This
    version has bug fixes that make it friendlier to perl 5.10, and
    - Use strict RFC-822 definition for header names: the field name can
      be made of anything but SPACE or colon, from ASCII 33 to ASCII 126.
    - The patchlevel is now ignored, as we track by SVN revision
      number. Changed all version information reporting to new format
      "version-revision".
    - Added automatic computation of the SVN revision in "revision.h", for
      later  perusal by Configure to propagate correct revision numbers in
      files.
    - Added update of revision.h.
    - Removed the WARNING level, as it is not critical enough to warrant a
      daily notification.
    - Changed path for checkagent.sh in the sample crontab entry.
    - Added bzip2 compressor.
    - Removed legacy hardwired HOME directory.  Compute it!
    - Removed more "$*" uses that are now forbidden by perl 5.10.
    - Integrated more changed from Debian:
      + Fixed maildir computation logic to avoid useless superseding.
      + Added regular expression for Top Level Domain validation.
      + Removed "compress" from the list of default compressors and added
        bzip2.
    - Cleaned up by fixing most of the items listed in Debian bug #43171
      Bug fix: "mailagent: several problems with the manual page", thanks
      to  swift@alum.mit.edu                                (Closes: #43171).
    - Ensure POST always puts a single space after the field name to avoid
      INN rejecting the article due to invalid header.
    - Do not process the queue in the background when invoked from
      terminal, unless given an explicit -q switch, naturally.
    - Added -U switch to disable first UNIQUE / RECORD rejection for
      duplicates.
    - Reduce maximum article age for POST to 10 days.
    - Look for utmp in /var/run as well, for modern systems with read-only
     /etc.
    - Cleaned up code a little bit since now Configure enables gcc
      warnings  by default and thus code required some uplifting.
    - Remove all usage of $* as it is no longer accepted by Perl 5.10.
    - Reset CDPATH to avoid pdksh's emission of the chosen dir on "cd".

  * A patch for the upcoming Perl 5.10 version was provided by the

    addressed. I am not closing 43171 until I, or someone else, refactors
    the manual page.

  * gcc-3.3 changed the behaviour when a object like macor's replacement

    Raphael Hertzog <rhertzog@hrnet.fr>, Raphael Manfredi
    <Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com>, and Barrie Stott
    <G.B.Stott@bolton.ac.uk> for all the help with mailagent while I have

mailagent (3.73-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload
  * This release supersedes the NMU 3.68-9.1, which was made concurrently.
    Therefore, some of the changes mentionned here are dups of previous
    changes, and the conflict was arbitrated in favor of this release.
  * New upstream release, closes: Bug#72737, and addresses the original
    concerns of Bug#43171.  Can't tell the latter is fully closed, since
    not all the followed-up points were addressed.
  * Fixed README spelling (verson -> version) and added special mention
    for the missing "getcost" program which can be found in original sources
    but is not packaged here.  Also added CPAN URL to the distribution.
    Removed paragraph of the README which mentionned a few patches that
    have been obsoleted by the new upstream version.
  * Added missing mailagent.cf, setup.cf and commands to /usr/share/mailagent,
    closes: Bug#81119.
  * Mailagent can now be used as a full mail<->news gateway.  Look into
    /usr/share/doc/mailagent/examples/news for the newsgate program which
    handles the news->mail part, as well as mailagent rules for building the
    mail->news part via mailagent's POST command.

mailagent (3.68-8) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Added more explicit documentation about why mailagent can not lock
    mailbox files on Debian (making mailagent sgid anything essentially
    negates any utility of having things sgid mail, a big gaping security
    hole). The details are now in the FAQ, the man page, and also in a
    file /usr/share/doc/mailagent/SECURITY. This issue is now also
    mentioned in the long description in the Control file.

    created a grave bug.
  * There was a bug in the postinst in a case statement, that caused

mailagent (3.58-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to standards version 2.4.0.0

mailagent (3.56-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a getspam script which shows how to get a list of spammers from
    the net.
  * Greatly updated the examples/rc stuff. Now it is a copy of my current
    mailagent configuration. This could be used as a drop-in after editing
    the usename and home directory location in dot.mailagent, but I
    recommend looking over the files carefully. The mailagent.rules
    included show how to split out Debian mailing lists, and apply spam
    filters to non-mailing list mail.
  * There have been reports of a possible perl bug with unpack that is
    triggered by mailagent (I have not been able to reproduce this),
    possibly associated with mh folders, which I hope may go away with
    this version (I am building with perl 5.004.02).

Old Changelog:

mailagent (3.44-7) unstable; urgency=low
 * Changed the postinst to make /usr/bin/mailagent executable again.
   This fixes bug#3432 and Bug#3504.
 * Changed debian.rules to use dpkg-name.
 * Changed the separators used all over to conform to the new nameing
   conventions.
 * Changed the postinst to refer to /usr/bin/perl, rather than /bin/perl,
   to  conform to an as yet unreleased guidelines.
 * Changed the priority option to dchanges to conform to the new version.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>

mailagent (3.44-6) unstable; urgency=low
 * There was a problem reported in that mailagent had a compiled
   in domainname (mostly harmless, I think, except that the filter
   reported that mail was filtered on whatever.pilgrim.umass.edu
   which is not true for very many machines.  Now the postinst
   tries to take care of it by editing /usr/bin/mailagent on the
   fly.
 * A problem that still persists is that reportedly mailagent does
   not honor the HOME directory when run out of root's crontab,
   (I have not yet tested this) . There well may be problems with
   crontab in general, this has been reported upstream, and I'll be
   attending to this ASAP.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>

mailagent (3.44-5) unstable; urgency=low
 * Added the Priority field to the package file name.
 * Added the Source field to the package file name.

   the same as the To list.  This fixes Bug#2983


 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>

mailagent (3.44-4) unstable; urgency=low
        * Added the architecture field to the package file name.
        * Modified maildist.1, maillist.1, and mailpatch.1 to not
          contain the full path name.  This fixes Bug#2798.
        * point to /usr/doc/copright/Artistic rather than install
          our own copy.
        * Gave up trying to fix the compress tests.  The fact is, we
          have gzip, thinly disguised as compress, and mailagent
          believes that compress should provide .Z files, not .gz,
          and gets very confused.  Gzipped folders work. We can't produce
          .Z folders anyway.
        * Fixed Configure idiocy about non-NIS domain name determination.
