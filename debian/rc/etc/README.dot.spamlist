The exmple files here are placeholders for real spam address files. 
Look at ../bin/get-spamlist to see how to generate a real copy of these 
lists. Since these sites are frequently updated, I do not want to hard 
wire the list into this package. Also, there are liability issues about 
censorship if we actually ship these lists.
