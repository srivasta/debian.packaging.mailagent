This directory contains:

	- fakesend : code for user-defined FAKESEND comamnd
	- getcost  : a score-based SPAM filter
	- mime     : an example of how to un-MIME all messages that don't need MIME
	- news     : a complete news <=> mail gateway
	- pbounce  : an example of mailer-daemon post-processing filter
	- shell    : an example of server command
	- unkit    : an example of filtering command extension

Those files are not installed, they are only provided as living examples.
There is a README file in each of those directories telling you more
about what they hold.

There are several ways to view these examples:

1) As real-life processing, code that you should be able to reuse or plug-in
   into your own processing if you have similar problems.

2) A repository of common useful extensions that you can study to learn more
   and create your own.

Feel free to share other successful experiences with me. I'll include them
there in future releases. When there will be too many of them, it will be
time to create CMAN, the Comprehensive Mailagent Archive Network ;-)
