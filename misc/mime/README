Here is a sample un-MIME feature using the FEED command.

The purpose of un-MIMEing is to remove MIME attributes from all the messages
that are simply text and therefore do not really require MIME processing.

When MIME attributes are rightfully used (to transmit multipart messages
and/or binaries such as images), the encoded binary part is automatically
extracted for you in ~/mail/MIME. Original MIME messages are also left
in the +mime MH folder.

There is also support for broken mailers that insert a Content-Type line
yet do not also add a Mime-Version header. Those messages are subject to
mis-interpretation of some of their characters, leading to wrong =xx
escapes all over the place... Fortunately, we have a rule dealing with that.

Okay. Now how can you setup this configuration?

This directory contains, besides this README file:

	. unmime: the heart of this un-MIMEing process.
	. rules: the rules you should insert at the top of your rule file.

Before jumping in and installing, you *must* make sure you have the
proper Perl extensions (you'll need Perl version 5 for this to work).
This can be done by running:

	perl -c unmime

If perl croaks, you need to wander on CPAN and look for the proper
perl extensions. You basically need MIME modules, but those may
have dependencies. Your best bet is to grab CPAN.pm and use that
to retrieve all the required extensions.

If you don't know where/what CPAN is, a good place to start is to
have a look at the following URL:

	http://www.perl.com/perl/index.html

and follow from there (probably the Software link, which should
lead you to CPAN eventually).

Once you can run 'perl -c unmime' without any errors, you're halfway
there. Now you need to decide where the MIME-decoded files will be
stored. I chose to hardwire ~/mail/MIME in the 'unmime' script, but
you may change this easily by editing the $TMPDIR variable at the
top.

Then, you need to insert the rules at the top of your rule file and
put the 'unmime' script at the proper place. The FEED actions have
the ~/mail/unmime path hardwired, so you'll need to edit that to
refer to the place you chose to put that script. Beware: there are
two spots using FEED...

If you don't use MH, you can change "SAVE +mime" into "SAVE mime"
within the rules themselves to save original real MIME messages
into a plain folder.
