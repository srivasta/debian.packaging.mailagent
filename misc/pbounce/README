This directory contains the implemetation for a new filtering action PATBOUNCE,
along with the necessary configuration files. The PATBOUNCE command is used to
automatically remove bad addresses from users file list, recorded via
@SH package commands.

This should be very useful if you distribute patches via e-mail for the
packages you maintain, and use dist-3.0 to maintain them. Otherwise,
it is a good example of how to post-process a bounce message and deal
with it.

The rules.cf file includes sample rules showing how PATBOUNCE is intended
to be used. You can include the lines from mailagent.cf into your ~/.mailagent
to configure the command.

Don't forget to install the new command by adding the line in newcmd.cf into
your newcmd file and installing the patbounce.pl file in the proper location
where mailagent can find it.
