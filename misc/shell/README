The following command allows the remote execution of arbitrary shell commands.
This may compromise the security of your account and/or system, so be very
careful when setting it up. Only someone with a 'shell' power will be allowed
to use that command.

To install, add the server.cf lines to your 'comserver' file, as defined in
your ~/.mailagent, then copy the 'shell' script to your 'servdir'.

To create the 'shell' power, become 'root' or 'system' and then do:

newpower shell PASSWORD
... fill in security clearance ...
... (your e-mail address) ...
EOF

Do not forget to select a good password for this power.

Here is an example:

set shell /bin/ksh
power shell PASSWORD
shell
pwd
ls -l
cat ~/.profile
EOF

The transcript session will return you the output from the shell. If you
do not select a shell via 'set shell', then /bin/sh will be used.

At any time, you may remove this remote shell access by commenting out or
removing the shell command from 'comserver'.
