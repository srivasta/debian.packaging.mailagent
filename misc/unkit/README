This directory contains the implemetation for a new filtering action UNKIT,
along with the necessary configuration files. The UNKIT command is used to
automatically unkit messages produced by the 'kit' binary tar-mailer.

Messages are left in a directory until all the kit parts have been received,
at which point 'unkit' is called and the session transcript is mailed back
to the user.

This was inspired by a shell script written by Christian Bertin
<bertin@acri.fr> and doing roughly the same thing. This perl version was
merely written as an exercise to see how easy/uneasy the command extension
process was.
